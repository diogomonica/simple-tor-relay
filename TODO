Back-end:
- We need to set-up a relay and see how much bandwidth we can get through it, if we can't get 250KB/s we're going to ahve to limit ourselves to bridges.
- Have an end-to-end test, for relays make sure the tor network can see it. Not sure what to do for bridges (look up log messages for private versus public)
- Create a mechanism to report back GPG-encrypted error logs in case deployment fails over Tor (to not easily reveal possible bridge addresses to DPI)
- Is 1TB upload or download as well?
- Add a swapfile? Would help w/ memory pressure, especially for 512mb nodes. Problem is most of the memory is consumed by the kernel and tor.

Front-end:
- The interface looks like shit and I've badly hacked up do-install-button, I'm not sure Tim's architecture is going to be exactly what we need. Might be worth cutting pieces out and making it less generic?
- For bridges you can get bridge identifiers, we should support showing these to the client. The only shitty thing is if someone is sniffing on the network, they can find bridges by tracking what hosts contact us. Maybe the back-end code should only connect to our front-end over Tor?
- Pass along advanced options for configuration to the install script
- Right now we only support $5 and $10 nodes because $20 only offers 50% more bandwidth than $10. Would be nice to allow people to specify $20/month and have it spin up 2 $10 nodes.
 + Automatically set Tor family in this case!
 + In which use standard pricing diagram like http://designscrazed.org/html-css-pricing-table-templates/
- Can we enable IPv6 by default?

- Calls to action after proper set-up:
 + (Relays) Set-up Tor Weather for monitoring
 + Make it viral, give them something to tweet/share (without pulling in FB/twitter/etc. privacy nvasive trackers) that they set-up a Tor bridge/relay.
  x For relays, offer to email a link with information about their Relay? Unfortunately Tor Atlas takes an hour to update and the initial stats are confusing because of the ramp-up. We could send a link and then explain why bandwidth will seem very low for 3 days
  x For bridges make sure they understand not to share their descriptor
 + Explain Tor families and why they should set them if they run multiple nodes

Operational:
- Decide on domain, register, get SSL certs.
- Web server config in front of sinatra with HSTS w/PFS ciphers + HPKP (!) + CSP (?)
- Securely generate and share the trusted GPG key

Documentation:
- Clearly document privacy trade offs, make giving-up privacy disabled by default
